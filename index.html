    <h1>The pangolin</h1>
    <h2>About the pangolin</h2>
    <p>
      The pangolin has scales, fixed at one end, and capable of being erected
      like the quills of the porcupine, at pleasure. The pangolin can roll
      itself into a ball, like the hedge hog, and present the points of its
      scales to the enemy. It chiefly keeps to the most obscure parts of the
      forest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The meat of the pangolin is considered a delicacy in some parts of the
      world, while their scales are used in traditional medicine in China and
      Vietnam. Indeed, Pangolins hold the dubious honour of being
      <em>the most trafficked animal in the world.</em>
